# Fall2021-Projects

## About the Projects

These final projects, developed in the context of the course Cloud and Big Data at Complutense University of Madrid, solve a data-intensive problem with parallel processing on the Google cloud. They have identified a data science problem, analysed its compute scaling requirements, collected the data, designed and implemented a parallel software, and demonstrated scaled performance of an end-to-end application.
